      <p class="para_">A simple way to know your <span class="span-bold">passion</span> is to first know your <span class="span-bold">patterns</span>, so what do I mean by patterns.</p>

      <p class="para_">Patterns are the structure that you see naturally in any field, which is unique to you.</p>

      <p class="para_">
         Like some people see patterns in <span class="span-bold">numbers</span>, so they are good at <span class="span-bold">mathematics</span>.
         Some see pattern in <span class="span-bold">words</span>, so they are good at <span>writing, communication</span>, etc.
         Some see pattern in <span class="span-bold">nature</span>, so they are good at <span>science, philosophy</span>,etc.
         Some see pattern in <span class="span-bold">music, design, colour, painting</span>, and the list is endless, you just have to find yours.
      </p>

      <p class="para_">
        <span class="span-bold">Stars</span> - Even something random like seeing patterns in Stars, is cool, there was a time in history,
        were it was the most useful skill, because those were the only people who use to navigate the ship,
        to sail through the vast unknown ocean to reach its destination, when there was no map.
