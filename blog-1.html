      <p>A simple way to know your passion is to first know your patterns, so what do I mean by patterns.</p>
      <p>Patterns are the structure that you see naturally in any field, which is unique to you.</p>
      <p>
         Like some people see patterns in numbers, so they are good at mathematics.
         Some see pattern in words, so they are good at writing, communication, etc.
         Some see pattern in nature, so they are good at science, philosophy,etc.
         Some see pattern in music, design, colour, painting, and the list is endless, you just have to find yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stars - Even something random like seeing patterns in Stars, is cool, there was a time in history,
        were it was the most useful skill, because those were the only people who use to navigate the ship,
        to sail through the vast unknown ocean to reach its destination, when there was no map.
      </p>
      <p>Some popular examples</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Newton - He saw pattern in common force of nature acting across planet, called Gravity.</li>
        <li>
           Darwin - He saw pattern in different species, and discovered "Theory of Evolution", which tells
           the truth that life on earth or anywhere in the Universe is a naturally occurring phenomenon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leonardo daVinci -He was an exceptional genius who saw patterns in multiple fields like painting,
          science, art, engineering, design, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
